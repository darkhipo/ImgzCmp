## Development and Install 

* I used JDK SE 1.8: [Link](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
* Eclipse Neon, x64, IDE for Java Dev, installed using the  **Eclipse Installer** [Link](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/eclipse-packages/)
* Within eclipse it is necessary to install the **M2E** plugin for maven. This should be pre-installed by the installer. [Link](http://www.eclipse.org/m2e/)
